# Course Description
This course is an introduction to **physical computing**. Physical computing, in the broadest sense, means building interactive physical systems that can sense and respond to the analog world. This class is an exploration of computing that starts from the perspective that humans are fundamentally physical beings. In this course, we take the human body as a given, and attempt to design projects that can interact with humans and the physical world. You will learn how a computer converts the changes in energy given off by our bodies (in the form of sound, light, motion, touch, and other forms) into changing electronic signals that it can read and interpret. We will learn about ways to integrate sensors, motors, and simple electronics into interactive objects.

The platform for the class is a microcontroller, a single-chip computer that can fit in your hand. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. Students will have weekly lab exercises to build skills with the microcontroller and related tools, and longer assignments in which they apply the principles from weekly labs in creative applications. Both individual work and group work is required.

Physical computing takes a hands-on approach, which means that you spend a lot of time building circuits, soldering, writing programs, building structures to hold sensors and controls, and figuring out how best to make all of these things relate to a person's physical expression. Although extremely technical, this course is not just about the technology; we will spend time each week discussing interaction design and what it means to incorporate electronic projects into our lives. Core interaction design concepts include user observation, affordances, and converting physical action into digital information.

Although programming is required to successfully complete projects and assignments, we will NOT be spending any time on introductory programming concepts. You should already be comfortable with general programming concepts (variables, loops, data types, etc.).



# Class Expectations
+ Arrive on time.
+ Turn cell phones off.
+ Bring your imagination.
+ Document everything to your blog!
+ Get comfortable with failure.
+ You can do this.



# Grading
Students will be assessed on conceptual ideas, technical skills, critical thinking, documentation, participation and attendance. Projects will be assessed on conceptual thought, creativity, originality and aesthetic qualities, experimentation and use of creative engineering solutions. Work must be presented on the date it is due (even if something isn't working!).

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

Attendance and Participation: 25% <br>
Documentation, Assignments, Quizzes: 40% <br>
Project 1: 5% <br>
Project 2: 12% <br>
Project 3: 18% <br>

A = excellent work (90-100%) <br>
B = above average work (80-89%) <br>
C = average or competent work (70-79%) <br>
D = below average work (60-69%) <br>
F = unsatisfactory work (0-59%) <br>

If you turn in all your work on time (and if it is satisfactorily completed), and if you attend class and participate, you are ensured a C. A's and B's are reserved for students who excel beyond average and competent work. You are required to earn a C letter grade or higher in order to continue course work in the TAM program.



# Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. You are allowed 2 absences (not applicable to critique days), every absence after that will result in the lowering of the final letter grade by 10%. Tardiness (arriving more than 10 minutes late or skipping out early) counts as a .333 absence.

Individual projects that are turned in late will result in the grade being lowered for that project. Feedback through the form of critique is also essential; absence from any of the class critiques will result in a drop of one letter grade for that assignment.



# Participation
This is a participatory course. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects. Be cognizant of how you interact in class discussions. If you find yourself commenting more frequently than most other people in the class, step back and give others a chance to contribute (even if you have something to say). If you tend to hesitate to join discussions, challenge yourself to jump in. Additionally, I encourage you to utilize the blogs as a way to connect with your classmates and share your ideas.

I take critiques very seriously. Even if your project is not fully completed, it is required that you come to class to give feedback on your classmatesâ€™ projects. It will affect your grade negatively if you do not show up for critique. Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need prepared, tested and ready to present. Student computers will be shut off and full participation is expected when projects are being presented.



# Projects
You will complete three detailed production assignments over the course of the term. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world.



# Labs & Quizzes
There is a lab activity for nearly every week during the first half of the semester. They are short, simple activities meant to help you understand the principles discussed in class and become familiar with physical computing technologies. 

Both in-class and take-home quizzes will be assigned throughout the semester.



# Readings & Assignments
Weekly assignments will include relevant readings, videos, and observation exercises. You are expected to document all work to your blog. This includes your successes, failures, reading responses, project ideas and inspirations.

*Readings are mandatory!* Come to class prepared to discuss any assigned reading materials; you will occasionally be given in-class pop-quizzes about any assigned readings. 



# Blog & Documentation
You are expected to keep an online journal of your progress in this course. At a minimum, I expect you to summarize any insights you have in each week's work, to discuss any readings, and to thoroughly document your production projects and technical research. I encourage you to read and comment on each other's posts.

Please make sure your blog assignments are online the night before class (by 11pm) to ensure that your classmates and I can read them before class.



# Materials
You will be provided with a basic prototyping kit for this course which will allow you to complete all necessary labs and homework assignments. 

You are required to bring the materials given to you each class period!

Any additional parts or materials required for midterm or final projects will be your responsibility to acquire. You should plan to budget approximately $200 for this course. Some projects can be completed for less than $15, others might require components and materials costing as much as $150+. 



# BTU Lab
This lab is your maker space!

In the second or third week of the semester we will run a lab orientation session during class. After completing this orientation, all enrolled Object students will officially become lab members. 

For more about the lab visit [BTUlab.com](http://www.btulab.com/)



# Course Content
The instructor of this class reserves the right to show a broad range of course materials, some of which assume the audience to be adult in age and demeanor. should a student feel offended by something they have seen or heard, it would appreciated, but not required, to stay to be part of the dialogue to offer your perspective. however if the student feels that they cannot stay, they are welcome to leave the classroom as discretely as possible.



# Freedom of Speech
This class is held in an academic university setting and due to the inherent nature of the internet and broad range of topics that your project work will explore it is inevitable that we will come across issues dealing with politics and religion. My role during such discussions will be a facilitator, a mediator, and as impartial as humanly possible. All students are encouraged to participate in open discussion and academic discourse.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES
*A full list of CU’s academic policies can be found online at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies](http://www.colorado.edu/policies).*

# Honor Code
All work/ideas/code must be original and created for this class. All code should be written from scratch by you - meaning that although some code is repeatable you should never copy and paste code from other sources and then find and replace your content into it. 

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Other information on the Honor Code can be found at [http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html](http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html) and at [http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/](http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/).

If you fail to meet a guideline by accident, we’ll discuss the situation without taking it to the Honor Council. But if I discover willful intent on your part, I’m obligated to report that to the Honor Council, which has the authority to enforce non-academic corrective action. I retain the authority to enforce academic sanctions, which will range from an F on the project to an F in the course, depending on the severity of the breach of trust.

# Classroom Behavior
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at [colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html](colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html) and at [colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code](colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code).
