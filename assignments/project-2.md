Create a prototype for an **Artificial Human Companion** (AHC). Think through the character and story that accompanies your AHC, i.e. visualize the world that your creation lives in. Is this AHC a pet of some sort? A partner/lover? A really needy alarm clock? Does she, he, they have a name? Gender preference? Are they autonomous? How do they relate with their human companions? Describe the person/persons your creation lives with or maybe it lives in isolation. Think through the relationship between the companions. What are the power dynamics between the two? 

While a working prototype is required, this is also an exercise in design fiction. Be as practical or fantastical as you want, all the while critically thinking through the relationship between humans and computers.

<br>
**Checkpoints:**

- Tuesday, September 20th - project proposal due on your blog
- Tuesday, October 11th - first iteration due / show a working-prototype in class
- **Thursday, October 20th** - in class demo / presentation of your working project
- Sunday, October 23rd by 8pm - final documentation due on your blog

<br>
**Your final blog documentation must include:**

+ a formal description / summary of the project (~500 words) 
+ ACH in situ (whatever format you chose)
+ high-quality photos or video of your finished project
+ drawings of the interaction 
+ a drawing of your circuit
+ the code for your project

<br>
**Project Evaluation Criteria: 20% each** <br>
Concept, Hardware, Software, Presentation, Documentation <br>
*(hardware and software will be graded based on individual skill levels)*

You are expected to document your work thoroughly on your blog as you go - your grade for this project will largely be based on your in-class demonstration and on the documentation you publish to your blog. Include details of all phases of the project. Include a project summary as well, explaining what the system you built is, what it does, and what purpose itâ€™s intended to serve. Your summary should introduce the project as if the reader has never heard of the project before.
