Copper tape switches

Use a multimeter to check connectivity

Series and parallel circuits with copper tape



**Tasks:**

1. Draw the schematic for a circuit with a power source, a push button, two LEDs, and any necessary resistors connected in **series**. Build this circuit.
2. Draw the schematic for a circuit with a power source, a push button, two LEDs, and any necessary resistors connected in **parallel**. Build this circuit.
3. Build each circuit you drew on paper with copper tape (one in series and one in parallel).
4. Build each circuit you drew on a breadboard (one in series and one in parallel).

**Blog Response:** 

+ Explain the difference between series and parallel circuits. Post photos of the circuits you built and label each with a caption. 
+ What kind of circuit would be a more reliable option for connecting several LEDs? Why?
