**Lab Objectives:**

+ Use a multimeter to check connectivity
+ Build circuits in series and parallel
+ Explore non-traditional materials
+ Draw schematics by hand

**Tasks:**

1. Build two circuits on paper with copper tape, each circuit should have two LEDs. In the first circuit, place the LEDs in series. In the second circuit, place the LEDs in parallel. (hint: use a coin cell battery, no resistors are necessary in these circuits).
2. On a breadboard, build two circuits, each with a minimum of two LEDs. One circuit should have the LEDs in series and the other should be in parallel. Use Ohm's Law to calculate the necessary resistor values in these two circuits given your particular power source. Draw schematic diagrams of each breadboarded circuit.
3. Build a custom switch (out of fabric, copper tape, paper, etc..) that connects to your breadboard and turns on an LED.

+ [Schematic Diagram Videos](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/videos/videos-schematic-diagrams/)

**Blog Response:** 

+ Briefly explain the difference between series and parallel circuits. What kind of circuit would be a more reliable option for connecting several LEDs? Why?
+ Post photos and of the circuits you built and label each with a caption. For the breadboarded circuits, also post a schematic drawing for each.

**Lab 2 is due before class on Tuesday September 6th.** Submit a link to your blog post on Edmodo.
