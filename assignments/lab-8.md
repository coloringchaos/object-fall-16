# **Lab Objectives:**

+ Send values serially to P5
+ Write a program to visualize the sensor data in P5js

# **Lab 6 Resources:**

+ [Serial Input to P5](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-input-to-the-p5-js-ide/)
+ [Serial Output to P5](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-output-from-p5-js/)

# **Part 1: Serial Input to P5**

1. Build a circuit with an analog sensor
2. Write an Arduino program to read that sensor value
3. Send the sensor value serially to p5 
4. Write a program to visualize the sensor data in P5


# **Part 2:**

Incorporate another sensor to control a different part of your visualization

*OR*

Add an output from P5 to Arduino (like, make an LED turn on or a motor spin).
