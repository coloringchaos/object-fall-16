**Lab Objectives:**

+ Learn to solder
+ Get your project off the breadboard

**Tasks:**

1. Choose a circuit that you made already in this class (from lab 1 or 2). Draw the schematic for that circuit, and transfer it to a small piece of a [protoboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13268). 
2. Solder your components to the board and figure out some way to power your circuit <br> *(pro tip: don't use components for this lab that you will miss being able to prototype with...)*


**Lab 2 Resources:**

+ Andy Sigler's [How to Solder Video](https://vimeo.com/107049478)


**Blog Response:** 

+ Post the following photos of what you made: a schematic drawing, progress photos, and your final soldered board. Is there anything you struggled with in this lab?

**Lab 3 is due before class on Thursday September 8th.** Submit a link to your blog post on Edmodo.
