Build a physically interactive project *without a microcontroller*. Your focus in this assignment should be on careful and timely sensing of the relevant actions of the person or people you’re designing for, and on a clear, prompt, and effective response. Any interactive system involves listening, thinking, and speaking from both parties.

*You must work individually on this project.*

#### **Project Requirements:**

+ Focus on a simple, well-crafted interaction
+ There must be some kind of switch
+ Your project must be housed in an enclosure (no visible breadboard!)
+ There must be feedback to the user (this could be in the form of light, sound, movement, etc.) 

#### **Grading Criteria:**

10 points each: Enclosure, Feedback & Interaction Design, Hardware, Creativity, Documentation

**Project 1 is worth 50 pts total**

You are expected to document your work thoroughly on your blog as you go - your grade for this project will be based on your in-class demonstration and on the documentation you publish to your blog. Include details of all phases of the project. Include a project summary as well, explaining what the system you built is, what it does, and what purpose it’s intended to serve. Your summary should introduce the project as if the reader has never heard of the project before.

**Your final blog documentation must include:**

+ a description of the project (1 paragraph)
+ details about how the project evolved and any challenges that were encountered (1 paragraph)
+ drawings of your interaction and of your circuit
+ high-quality photos or video of your finished project


#### **Due Dates:**

**Tuesday, September 13th** - in-class demonstration and critique of finished project

**Friday, September 16th @ 8pm** - documentation due to your blog. Submit a link to your blog documentation on Edmodo.
